# Replace Method with Method Object

## Problem

You have a long method in which the local variables are so intertwined that you canâ€™t apply Extract Method.

```typescript
class Order {
  // ...
  price(): number {
    let primaryBasePrice;
    let secondaryBasePrice;
    let tertiaryBasePrice;
    // Perform long computation.
  }
}
```

## Solution

Transform the method into a separate class so that the local variables become fields of the class. Then you can split the method into several methods within the same class.

```typescript
class Order {
  // ...
  price(): number {
    return new PriceCalculator(this).compute();
  }
}

class PriceCalculator {
  private _primaryBasePrice: number;
  private _secondaryBasePrice: number;
  private _tertiaryBasePrice: number;

  constructor(order: Order) {
    // Copy relevant information from the
    // order object.
  }

  compute(): number {
    // Perform long computation.
  }
}
```

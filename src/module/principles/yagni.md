# YAGNI

YAGNI stands for You Ain’t Gonna Need It. It’s a principle from software development methodology of Extreme Programming (XP). This principle says that you should not create features that it's not really necessary.

This principle is similar to the KISS principle, once that both of them aim for a simpler solution. The difference between them is that YAGNI focus on removing unnecessary functionality and logic, and KISS focus on the complexity.

Any work that's only used for a feature that's needed tomorrow, means losing effort from features that need to be done for the current iteration.

Creeping featurism leads to code bloat; the software will becomes larger and much more complicated.

Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.

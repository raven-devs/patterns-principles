# DRY

DRY stands for Don’t Repeat Yourself. It’s a software development principle with the goal of removing logic duplication.

Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

It’s important to mention that misusing DRY (creating functions where we don’t need to, making unnecessary abstractions, and so on) can lead to more complexity in our code rather than simplicity.

Readability and Simplicity

Using the DRY principle can sometimes make your code too complicated and difficult to understand. You might try so hard to avoid repeating code that you end up with a big mess that’s hard to maintain. Sometimes, it’s easier to just repeat code rather than trying to come up with a fancy solution. In those cases, you have to think carefully about whether the benefits of DRY outweigh the downsides of making your code harder to read and simpler.

Abstraction?

Premature abstraction is a problem you might face if you stick to the DRY principle too strictly. It happens when you try to make your code reusable and general before you really get the whole picture of what you’re working on or what it might need in the future. This can lead to confusing and overly complicated code that makes things harder to figure out, fix, and keep up with. It’s important to strike a balance between reusing code and keeping things abstract.

Coupling?

When you stick to the DRY principle, sometimes you might accidentally link different parts of the system together(coupling) in ways you didn’t mean to. By getting rid of repeated code and making shared parts, you could end up making unrelated sections of the app depend on each other. This can make it harder to change or add to the system, since tweaking one part might mess up other parts. In situations like this, it’s actually better to let some code be duplicated, so that unrelated pieces stay separate and easier to manage.

Optimising?

One more issue with sticking to the DRY principle is focusing too much on making the code smaller or thinking it’s more efficient, while ignoring important stuff like how easy it is to read, keep up with, and how well it performs. Having less code might look like a step up, but just looking at the size or number of lines doesn’t always mean the code is actually better. Keep the big picture in mind and aim for a good balance between reusing code, making it readable, and easy to maintain.

Flexibility?

Finally, following the DRY principle might sometimes make your code less flexible. When you make a shared part to avoid repeating code, you could keep it from being adaptable. If what you need changes, you might realize that the shared part is too rigid and tough to change, which could make it even harder to maintain than if you just let some code be duplicated in the first place.

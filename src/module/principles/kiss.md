# KISS

KISS stands for “Keep It Simple, Stupid”. It’s a principle in software engineering that suggests that systems work best when they are simple and easy to understand, rather than complex. The idea is to make code easy to read, maintain and debug.

1. Clearly define the problem and requirements.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
3. Choose the simplest solution that meets the requirements.
4. Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
5. Test and debug thoroughly.
6. Refactor and optimize as necessary.
7. Keep the code simple, modular, and maintainable.

Simple in this context doesn’t necessarily mean easy, It simply means producing the same results or a better result with less effort or complexity. In the concept of KISS, we neither want just less nor more, we simply wish to have only as much as is required.

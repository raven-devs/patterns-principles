# Persistence Ignorance

Persistence Ignorance is a principle in software development that suggests that domain objects should not be responsible for their own persistence mechanism. This allows for better separation of concerns, making the code more maintainable and flexible. In TypeScript, violations of Persistence Ignorance can occur when domain objects have direct knowledge or dependencies on the persistence layer.

```typescript
// Domain object
class User {
  private id: number;
  private name: string;
  private email: string;

  constructor(id: number, name: string, email: string) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
  }

  saveToDatabase() {
    // Direct database logic here
    // Violates Persistence Ignorance principle
  }
}

// Usage
const user = new User(1, 'John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com');
user.saveToDatabase();
```

In the above example, the User class is responsible for its own persistence logic through the saveToDatabase method. This violates the Persistence Ignorance principle because the domain object should not be directly responsible for saving itself to the database. Instead, this responsibility should lie within a separate persistence layer, such as a data access object (DAO) or repository.

To adhere to the Persistence Ignorance principle, you could separate the persistence logic from the User class.

```typescript
// Adhering to Persistence Ignorance

class User {
  private id: number;
  private name: string;
  private email: string;

  constructor(id: number, name: string, email: string) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
  }

  // Getters and setters...

  // No persistence logic here
}

// Separate persistence layer
class UserRepository {
  save(user: User) {
    // Database logic here
  }
}

// Usage
const user = new User(1, 'John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com');
const userRepository = new UserRepository();
userRepository.save(user);
```

In this modified example, the User class does not contain any persistence logic, and the responsibility for saving the user to the database is delegated to the UserRepository class. This separation adheres to the Persistence Ignorance principle, making the code more maintainable and flexible.
